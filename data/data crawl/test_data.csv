Once I went to pick up a 2012 jetta they ended up giving me a 2016 jetta tryed to tell them it was the wrong car over and over they said I was lying and they were about to close for the day. I was so frustrated I said fuck it they will realize soon enough. The next day I got about ten calls that started as nice apology &#39;s then went to threats and screaming. I called the guy back and said come get your fucking car and bring me mine. Made him get everything perfect on the car before I handed him the keys. He said it didn&#39;t have to be this way. I laughed and said I would get going if I were you he said why? I left the car below e he ran out of gas on the next street. Treat others how u want to be treated.,negative

Why I always tell people to tip the drivers they already doing you a service. Putting their lives at risk in dangerous weather so people like these scumbags have food. Majority of delivery drivers make minimum wage. I worked in NY as a delivery driver making 7$ an hour when minimum wage was 11$ I basically survived off tips. Worked 11-12 hr shifts 6 days a week. You meet some great people and you meet a lot of assholes. Working in a low income area and people thought they better then you. If I had a good day I’d bring home 200-250$ before paying for gas. Most days were about 100$-150$ It was decent for me to live off until I found something that was less hours with an average pay of 350$,negative

Moments of note: I delivered a $150 dollar order to Madonna&#39;s tour crew. No tip. 38 Special tour bus (with the band sitting right there) No tip. Downtown Julie Brown&#39;s dance group, Julie Brown sitting right there. No tip. People are just clueless.

"I was a pizza delivery driver before.  The worst customer that I have gotten was working at a hospital in San jose california. She ordered 3 pizzas. The time I went to deliver was the time rush hour started (she knew,she lives there). When I got there (i was late due to traffic) I had to look for the building , look for parking, talk to front desk to find location, go up the elevator find the room that she was staying in.  When I found her she was mad at me for being late. One of the pizzas had a missing ingredient. She made it difficult on giving payment. She started talking down on me . I was close to throwing everything in.her face and telling her its on the house. that job was my only source of income at that time so I couldn&#39;t do that. Kept my cool and followed rules and regulations. So I apologized for the inconvenience. She left no tip.the struggles of Minimum wage job .minimum was 10.35 at the time and rent was 2k there was no way I was staying.",negative

"Youtube algorithm striking hard today. Earlier it was a 4 year old vid, now this one - 8 years old lol.<br><br>Anyways, rarely do you actually pay the exact amount for a pizza delivery. It&#39;s a silent understanding that since the person&#39;s delivering your food and is not at a cash register, getting exact change back might not happen, or at the very least - it&#39;ll be annoying and time consuming for both parties. However, if one were to ask for it back, then they should get it back. But they gave him 2 twenties and 2 fives for a $42 dollar purchase. If they actually wanted exact change back, why the extra five dollar bill? It&#39;s very safe to assume they didn&#39;t want change back, and that extra five+2 bucks from the other five dollar bill was a tip (Gonna guess the missing 1 dollar was what was left after the tax, so just coins) Very, very obvious they did not ask for change back either, and if they wanted it...why didn&#39;t they stop him before he left? Why did they give him all the money in the first place?<br><br>My assumption - Someone in there realized they wanted change back <b>after</b> the fact, and became a Karen about it. Gonna guess it was that woman that straight up threatened the dude.<br><br>Really I just find it all hilarious. I would&#39;ve happily let him have the 7 bucks whether I meant to or not.

I could not take the button out of my mind,  on the 3 day...I heard this voice inside my head that was screaming at me about the darn button....I could not take it any longer ...so I went to my mother and told her what I have done...she was surprised and after a few minutes of thinking (what to me seem like hours) she told me that telling her was not enough.... that I had to !!!confessed my crime and attoned for what i have done.!!!!.... So...we went back to the store and spoke to the manager... and told him about the button. I told him that I wanted to buy the garment (it was new) ...He was also surprised after my confession and he told me they already fix it and that he did not know how much it cost to fix it...and that there was no need, that all was good. My mom offered to pay for it again and the man kindly refused.  My mom gave him our address to send a bill when he find out the cost of the repair. About a week later I man in the clothing store uniform knock in our door and I happened to open the door for him. He informed me he had a package for.... and said my name... I was a bit scared when I saw his uniform and heard my name. Nevertheless I told him it was me. He smiled and handed me a package. After he was gone I opened the package and there it was ....a navy blue sweater with the beautiful buttons (like the one I stoled)...and a little bag with 2 extra buttons marked  &quot;IN CASE OF EMERGENCY&quot;...I DON&#39;T NEED TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH HIS KINDNESS WAS BURNED IN TO MY MEMORY... and me been A MISCHIEVOUS RASCAL......

Busy day comes and 2 of our drivers both call in sick, leaving 1 driver. Being one of the few people with a vehicle, I get put into driving anyways. Having stupid policies at the place too, the main driver gets the close deliveries to be more efficient so I get the crap long trips, first delivery of the night was 28 miles round trip. Pretty easily 2 gallons of gas used for that one delivery. 15 minutes early too, the person at the residence is livid for whatever reason claiming that I was late. Showed her the receipt that said delivery takes roughly an hour, order placed at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2d2HLdBF88&amp;t=390"">6:30</a> I was there at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2d2HLdBF88&amp;t=435"">7:15</a>. She got snippy and said whatever, and handed me exact change for the bill, looked me right in the eyes and said, you&#39;re welcome. I said nothing and left. Get back to work, manager is on the phone, looks at me, asked if I just delivered a pizza to a certain address, said yes. Said she was on the phone with that person. Complaining that I was rude, unruly, and unappreciative. I wasn&#39;t a very out spoken person at that point, it was deliver the pizza, and leave. I&#39;m not obligated to have conversation, or show appreciation to someone for no reason. Thankfully my manager was awesome, she told the customer, I already know how the situation went, I know my employee, he is not a designated delivery driver, he opted to deliver your pizza because we were short staffed, then you are disrespectful when he was early with your order, don&#39;t even offer a tip, then expect him to be thankful? You&#39;re not the type of customer I want to do business with, good bye. I miss that place every once in a while but, delivering sucks. I never profited from the tips, they all went towards gas money and then some out of my pocket. But once again, my manager was awesome enough to compensate me because she knew I drove a truck. She would offer food, and some extra compensation for me taking those deliveries. Something you don&#39;t see too often anymore.",neutral

"I can see both sides on this one.  I understand why the delivery guy would think it was a tip since the payment included $5 bills.  However, I can also see why those paying would be upset if the guy just assumed it was a tip and didn&#39;t even acknowledge the tip... assuming that he didn&#39;t.  I mean, people overpay all the time by accident.  He just assumed he was entitled to it.  That isn&#39;t how tips work though.  You are supposed to provide good service, have a good attitude, etc.  Just taking money and assuming it is a tip and not an over payment is not good service imo... not even close.  So, I can see the car dealership&#39;s position on this also.  That said, I wouldn&#39;t have made the guy come all the way back with it.  Unless he had a bad attitude on top of this then it is hardly worth making a big issue out of it.",neutral

If your bill is 43 dollars and you have 2 20s and a 5 that&#39;s all that&#39;s needed. Usually you tip delivery people cause they dont get paid much to begin with.

"What is the purpose of our existence? Is it simply to have a good job, build a family, and enjoy life? Is that all there is? Certainly not. We’re made for so much more. Your purpose is to know God. After we die, the Bible says we’ll face God as our Judge. Have you ever rebelled (sinned) against God? Examine yourself by God’s Law, the Ten Commandments. Have you ever told a lie? Ever stolen (the value is irrelevant)? Jesus said, “Whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” In God’s courtroom, our sins are very serious crimes. They’re so evil that the just punishment is death and eternity in a terrible place called Hell. <br>The Bible says that God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked. He is rich in mercy and provided a Savior: “God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” Jesus Christ died on the cross, paying the death penalty for sinners. He then rose from the dead three days later, defeating death. Hundreds saw Him after His resurrection; it’s no fairy tale. Jesus fulfilled all the prophecies about the promised Savior, written in the Holy Scriptures hundreds of years before His birth. <br>Religious rites, sacred traditions, or attending church can’t save you. Salvation is a free gift of God that you can’t earn. To know God and have your sins forgiven, do what the Bible says: repent and believe. Trust in Jesus as you’d trust in a parachute—don’t just “believe” it can save you, put it on and cling to it with all of your being. Wholeheartedly commit yourself to following Christ, and turn your back on sin. Then show your gratitude by obeying His command to be baptized. Be sure to also join a Christian church and read the Bible daily. God will never let you down.",positive

If they didnt wanna tip and get their change back all they had to do was give two 20s and one 5 (45) to cover the 42 bill. Giving that extra 5 was pointless but by doing so it make one assume it&#39;s for tip.,neutral

"Receive eternal life/live forever in the next few moments:<br>Every person is equally sinful in the sight of God, so God came in the flesh/body to reconcile the world to Himself. Jesus is God according to the Spirit (God is a Spirit, you cannot see Him and He cannot die), and was man according to the flesh. Jesus lived a sinless life. The gospel is that he died for our sins, was buried, and rose from the dead on the third day. On the cross, God forsook/abandoned/left the man Jesus Christ and judged him in our place. He paid the sin debt of the entire world with his blood.<br>When was asked, “What must I do to be saved?” the response was, “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.” It’s a free gift, not of works/doing things/not doing things, otherwise we could boast/brag. The moment you believe the gospel, you pass from death to life and shall not come into condemnation/judgement because God now sees you as a perfect sinless spirit; you have His righteousness/perfection/goodness. Because the sin debt according to the law has been paid for the entire world, people are only condemned because of unbelief. Trusting the gospel is all you can and must do to receive eternal life.<br>Most people who say they are Christians don’t believe this; we must believe that He saved us all on His own.

What&#39;s absolute gold in all this is that the video was recorded by the Car lot and not the pizza guy.

"I&#39;m going to play Devils Advocate and just say that tipping is a courtesy, its not mandatory. Also being a former pizza delivery person, when someone hands you more money then the bill it is standard practice to ASK if they are wanting change back. You don&#39;t ASSUME that you get to keep the change. So in that instance, the delivery guy was wrong, but the car dealership was so out of line, the guy made a mistake, came back and rectified said mistake. For the dealership to act like they did, was very unprofessional and shows what type of people you will deal with if you buy a car from them. Bottom line, don&#39;t assume your getting a tip, but people need to also realize folks make mistakes.",neutral

That delivery was on the border of our delivery area and parking at a hospital is a pain.   You would think someone would have waited by the door.  Nope I had to park and wait around for 15 minutes for a buck.  It wasn’t even worth the time for our pizzeria to make and driver the food.,negative

You could spend $50-$100 on booze.<br><br>They literally walk up and hand you the bottle and glasses then walk off and want like a $20 tip? Why???,negative

If the  bill was 42 dollars why not hand him 45 if you wanted your change.. I would have thought the same thing that it was a tip.

Cartels are controlling Americans remotely. They use the same frequency for communication. They can scream at me through my television. Back last August they shocked my ears every second and screamed at me for months to kill myself. I went to the turning point of russellville arkansas and people leaving that day were waiting on me to show up in there. It says it&#39;s for adults but they locked me in there with a little girl. I&#39;m pretty sure they wanted me to molester her or so something to her as a gang initiation. Someone called a person and he answered the phone and said he&#39;s scared and hung up. And then the phones quit working all togther. Now they are shocking my private parts with this frequency. It tightens up muscles even the stomach. They can make you throw up instantly. It&#39;s a tool to force people into labor. Everyone sells there drugs for free. There&#39;s been quite a few deaths and everyone in these gangs are just as responsible for those deaths.,negative

Deal with the exact same thing as a courier driver. Usually when delivering to intitled businesses used to trampling over whoever they want. Thinking they are actually important.

"I used to live in really bad neighborhoods where the delivery guys literally put their lives on the line trying to make a living. Whenever I ordered I would have one of my teenaged sons pay when the food arrived. The delivery guys, at first, looked at my kids in shock. There was always a nice tip included. Over time, when they would come they were always very happy to see us and one delivery man in particular, a nice young asian man, confessed that he thought all black people were mean and hateful...he said after knowing my family he was wrong. That following Christmas we gave him a holiday card with a gift card inside. The look on his face was priceless. It was well worth it. Years later, my oldest son called me and told me he happened to be in the old neighborhood visiting an old high school friend. Out of curiosity, he stopped by the carryout where the asian delivery guy worked. He was still there! When he saw my son he literally leaped over the counter to greet him. They spent a little time talking and sharing experiences over the years. This really moved my son as it did me because the guy mentioned me! He said &quot;you&#39;re mother...she is a good woman. She did good raising you all. Tell her thank you and I will never forget her kindness and generosity.&quot; He went on to confide to my son that because of us, he never judged all people the same again. I always figured if whenever we were blessed with enough to splurge on delivery food every now and again, then we had enough to give a tip. Pay It Forward.",positive

If i want money i work and if i want more money i work harder. <br>If i had accepted money just because the customer forgot to claim his change and just expected me to give him, i would have been fired too and rightfully so.

For those who do not understand how $42 plus $7 = $50 read.

I think it&#39;s safe to say, that it&#39;s generally understood in those circumstances that when you give a delivery driver a sum of money, you&#39;re giving it to them, not looking for change.  Now I suppose the driver could have offered the change back and thsi would have changed, but I have never heard of anyone getting upset like that over change, let alone $7.  If you guys are in the used car business and $7 matters that much, you must not be doing a good job at selling cars, and/or are very crooked.",negative

"Nobody is in the right here. On the one hand, the car sales people gave the man an extra bill that they could’ve kept, and it seems they did that so that they’d have a valid reason to bitch and complain. On the other hand though, the delivery man should not have assumed that it was a tip and should have asked before he walked out that door. Plus, he decided to be a complete smart ass about it, and that rightly pissed off the female employee and triggered her to say something. You can’t say things like now everything‘s right in the world without getting an equally sarcastic response back, or in this case, an angry response. If he just kept his mouth shut, handed them the money back, and walked out the door, none of this would’ve even happened in the first place. Also, I love how we’re donating thousands of dollars to someone on Go Fund Me because they didn’t get a tip, but people who are struggling and have kids in the hospital with cancer or are about to have their homes foreclosed on are shit out of luck when it comes to raising any sort of money.

I gave a $50 bill for a $30 meal and the server actually asked me if I wanted my change! I said yes, then gave her $8. I felt $20 was too high a tip for a $30 meal.

"I guess I am about to get slammed on the internet as well for what I am about to say but I don’t even understand why are ppl so mad about at the dealer and so defensive of the delivery man? I’m still confused🤔 I’m my missing anything that everyone else is seeing?<br><br>First of all, both the driver and the reported need to go back and retake the math test cause it is obvious that they failed it. How you have a $42 bill, you give $50 to pay and you get back $7 when the bill was not $43. They should get back $8.<br><br>Secondly, not only the delivery man took the money without doing what he was supposed to and on top of that the dude comes with an attitude at the customer? Wth. <br><br>I can see why he would have thought that it was a tip but if we are going to assume, we can also assume that the man just collected all of the bills from everyone else and didn’t even counted and trusted that since everyone pichel in pitched in there must be enough and some left over or that just like the driver and the reported, he also failed the math test and couldn’t add.<br><br>The delivery man should not have assumed shit. He should have done his job right and tell the customer, sr. the bill is only $42 and you gave me way more...here’s your $5 back and let me get you the rest. Period. Then they could have decided if they wanted to let him keep the rest.<br><br>But what he does, he comes talking crap like a child, “why did you give me the bill if you were going to make me drive back to bring it to you anyways? Excuse me! You take money that isn’t yours and there’s a problem for you to bring it back? What he should have said was, “ Sr., I apologize, to be honest with you, I thought that since you gave me more than the actual amount, I thought the rest was for me to keep...it was my mistake.”<br><br>But instead, he brings an attitude and the employees were supposed to just let him run his mouth and not say anything when he started all of it? On top of it, he said, “You got your $7 back the world is even or great or something like that.” No it is not cause your sorry ass still stole $1 cause you were supposed to give back $8.<br><br>In conclusion, if the pizza place allowed this employee to do what he did and go off on a customer when he was not right, I can only imagine how the employees treat others. Not a place that I would even bother buying.<br><br>As for the dealer I was on their side but not after they fired the woman for speaking back. She maybe went to far but so did the driver and he did not get fired. I am a firm believer of giving and tipping but on my terms not on anyone else’s",negative

It is clear this was the store video.  So one of those jerks thought it was a wonderful idea to post it online because they were proud of what they did.  I waited tables for many years while I was in the Air Force and people treat service workers like dirt.  I guess when you have low self esteem you take any opportunity to try to show that you are better than another person.  Love it when it back fires on them.  Loved when people would eat half their meal and then complain and refuse to allow me to correct whatever the problem is and insist that I comp the food.  I would always take care of their request.  Of course when I came back to clear dishes I would make a point of putting dirty dishes on top of their half eaten meal.  Invariably they would complain and say they were going to take it home.  I would apologize and explain that I naturally assumed they did not want it since it was disgusting or whatever term they used to get the food for free.  I never understand when people mess with people preparing or delivering food to them.  I went to culinary school and would never do anything to their food.

"I have ordered pizzas and every single time if i dont have exact change the delivery guy or girl starts counting out the change back to me. I always tell them to keep it, its the tip. but to assume that there is a tip is wrong. Some people do not tip. others over tip. In my opinion the delivery guy or girl should get a tip. It is their vehicle getting the wear and tear, their gas getting burnt up, and they dont make that much hourly anyway so they rely on tips. <br><br>Now, if I was that guy delivering, and someone (man or woman) threatened to put their foot in my ass over a tip/ no tip misunderstanding they would be eating my fist instead of that pizza. Threats are unnecessary. A threat is an action meant to induce fear, and the laws of physics require an equal and opposite reaction.",negative

I always tip my pizza dudes or dudettes well.  Their job sucks and a lot of them are people just trying to scrape by.  If I’m spending 50$ 5$ tip is only 10%.  Why do we only tip pizza guys 10% but restaurant servers 20%??   I give me 60$ on a 50$ order everytime.  My old lady put herself through nursing school to get her bachelor.  She taught me to always tip well and when someone is living off tips every bit helps.  Imagine making 1000$ a week I tips and only 150$ in wages for hourly.  Your measly 7$ an hour doesn’t equate to a living wage and only covers your taxes from tips. And even have times where you paycheck was negative. Unless you’ve worked at a tip employee you probably don’t get it. Anyway.  My old lady got a contract with state as an RN and now makes 6 figures as a nurse.  But we always make sure to tip well unless the server is just horrible but we also let them know when we give them a lower tip so maybe in the future they take more pride in their job if they wanna make a better tip.   My wife would make triple the tips as most back then because she went to work specifically to earn tips and worked her ass off  and smiled to the shitbag people who ere assholes to her and made sure customers were taken care of even if they sucked.  Sometimes other tables would double tip her after watching other costumers treats her like shot and her just take it and smile. She said there’s always the no tippers or mean costumers but enough good ones who tipped well to make up for it.  The other girls would do work and milk their time and text on phone and gossip etc.  they get excited over 100$ tip day.  My wife made average 300-400$ a day in tips.  Those other severs should have taken note.  She ended up making more than the managers every year she worked there just in tips.,positive

As someone who has delivered pizza. This happens more than you would think. Getting treated like garbage. No tips or 20cent tips in a blizzard. You have great customers that tip well even on sunny days but these shit bags should be ashamed. This was entertainment nothing more. Drivers make min. Wage to nothing an hour just tips and delivery charge. Some of us work on our on vehicles just to keep cost down but many don&#39;t and if you know the prices a mechanic chargers its not cheap.

"Well imagine this, I was in a very serious, near fatal car crash back in March 14, 2002. Guess how much fu ds I received? 0, a big fat nothing. I cannot work to this day, have ptsd, high anxiety, headaches, nightmares. Guess what I was told by my previous doctor after coming to him complaing about the pains, &quot;you&#39;re young, you can handle it&quot;. I was 22 when it happened. I am now 40, and in constant pain. My new doctor helps but financially, I get nothing. I will also mention that I am a black man, so maybe there was racial profiling going on, and that is why I received 0 assistance. I cannot file a claim because I just found out that after 10 years, you can&#39;t file a claim........Well, I Am livid, all the doctor had to do was send me in for x-rays to see what was wrong(in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011.)I lost all of those years financially.

"i worked as a housekeeper. One day I came into the room and there was what I thought was a tip. This family were pigs, absolutely filthy people. You don&#39;t have to have your room cleaned on a daily basis, but these people trashed the huge suite so bad &amp; would request service. The money was right when you opened the door to the left. Normal people dont leave money lying around when they have strangers coming in their room. So I thought wow finally they tipped me, they appreciate me going above &amp; beyond to make their stay comfortable. I collected what appeared to be a tip of 7$. It wouldn&#39;t be unusual for someone to leave you 2$ or 5$ or 7$ i even received  20$ 5 times during the 5 months i worked there. Long story short the man was sitting with his cat in the hallway waiting for me to finish. I come out and i say hey the 7$ is for me right.. he looks at me confused. . no?..... I say oh.. okay??   i felt extremely weird. never had this happen before. put the money back on the counter where normal people usually leave money to tip you. counter or bed is typical. my boss came down the hallway &amp; asked me what was going on. I told her he left money out but it wasn&#39;t for me.. my boss was like wow how stupid of him. &amp; she totally understood. point of my story is they were eating like kings,  partying like pigs, having me do extra work daily for them &amp; i didn&#39;t receive a tip the whole time. 7$ wouldn&#39;t have killed him. 200$ a night hotel.",negative

"I feel this was a bad case of assumptions on both sides. The old saying goes if you assume you make an ass out of you and me.<br><br>Fair Assumption 1. Customer assumed they would get change back. Which is common. Especially considering most corporate based pizza chains add a delivery fee to the bill. Delivery personnel is required to give you your change. Unless you tell them to keep the change. Which the customer did not say.<br><br>Just a plain Assumption 2. Delivery driver assumed because the customer gave him all sizable bills he was allowed to not break it and keep the change  <br><br>Now well established mom and pop eateries that deliver around a certain area for  yrs are used to getting tips from their long time customers and even new ones based on their reputation in the area.<br><br>What went wrong?<br><br>Bad customer service from the moment money was exchanged. Driver should always carry change on him period. He should&#39;ve of at least asked if the customer  wanted their change before leaving. Otherwise that is technically theft. You Dont see supernarkets or other places of business do a similar practice.<br><br>The customer was exercising their right as the consumer to speak to the manager and get their change back. The delivery driver returns with the change and gives the customer attitude in response. Once again bad customer service. I have worked in retail and food service for most of my job history if I did that I would either get a write up,suspended, or even fired on the spot!<br><br><br>Too make matters worse the internet stood up for bad customer service. Based on emotional reactions to a video. I&#39;m sure the driver vented to his customers, the customers brigaded on his behalf, the video verified his claims even though he was in the wrong. Video goes viral internet decides its a cause and &quot;cancels&quot; a business by posting unwarranted bad reviews on yelp. Unwarranted meaning  many didnt  use that business services  to fairly warrant a fair review.<br><br>Damage has been done. Worse thing the business manager did was apologize and try to make amends giving the driver money via a donation.<br><br>This must of happened on the east coast were a salty attitude is given leeway to mom and pop businesses.<br><br>The question is who got a hold of the video and uploaded it 0_0? An employee with a vendetta? The dumb manager posted it as proof of the drivers bas customer service? Or the tape was stolen by fan of the pizza place? Who knows.<br><br>But the driver was in the wrong in this battle of assumptions. Yet the customers came off as the asses when they had a legit reason to.",negative

"As a delivery driver myself Ive actually experienced having to take money back to a Customer who called the shop and said they gave too much money for a tip. People treat us (delivery drivers) as if we should be happy to deliver their food, for free. I didn&#39;t long to be a pizza delivery person or dream of it as a child. I never wanted to grow up and deliver food it&#39;s a job and if people would respect us there is a potential to make a living. I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve been stiffed and not by the customers you would think but by lawyers and bankers. I take pride in my work no matter what I do, it&#39;s how I was raised. I make sure your order is correct and everything you ordered and asked for is at place on time. It costs money to put gas in my car and time and effort to get your order to you. Why people don&#39;t tip or in the case of the video throw a temper tantrum over a few bucks is beyond my grasp. That asshole saying he wants the driver fired over $7 is absurd. Cheers to the driver for his handling of the situation. ",negative

Then, when walking to the parking lot, I realized it and went back to give him the correct tip and explain myself. The guy would have nothing to do with me because he was understandably upset.

I mean, it was my stupid mistake, he deserved the tip at that time, I should have realized why he came and asked me, but I kind of felt that righting things wasn’t worth the effort.

Dude we dont count the money in front of you because its insulting the customer so the way you do it is tell us how much your giving us an we ask do you need change.    These car lot guys are morons.  You want change tell us how much is there then say keep it ....if it&#39;s a tip<br>  If not as you hand us cash and say .... heres  $55. We respond then you need change?  That&#39;s were you respond as customer no or give 5 keep rest or yes change please.     These guys didnt tip this driver there rude. You do know the tip is for are gas car upkeep an car payment.  Receipt tips are taxed cash are not.    I have alot of far deliverys that dont tip  and it&#39;s like $2 in gas to get there and back stack those with 4 or 5 like that. Ya I&#39;m out on A tank of gas it rude. It&#39;s are cars we use.  If you dont wanna tip us fine get up and go drive yourself use your own gas  but most of you wont and you&#39;ll argue delivery charge which even I think us dumb companys take a cut if delivery but again there not paying us any of the delivery charge  that&#39;s stores in pocket pay  an there not out here either.

Unless you tell them to keep it specifically they are supposed to ask and clarify that they are to do so. <br><br>A family whose saved up for pizza I could understand but this was a business and people had chipped in together.

When they take off with it like that they are technically stealing so yes- it&#39;s important to verify the tip.<br><br>To be clear- the guy we got that took off ended up with no tip for having done so- all because he took off quite on purpose with the money knowing he was in direct violation.

The guy was complained about and ended up not getting the five bucks he&#39;d have gotten if he hadn&#39;t of run off.

"Arthur Booth was released from jail ten months later where Judge Mindy Glazer and his family were there to greet him. They reunited, hugged, and Booth said Judge Glazer was his inspiration. He&#39;s going to serve 10 years probation and has to attend a rehab for his drug and gambling addictions. His family said he was selected for Nautilus Middle School, one of the best schools in 1970s Miami, because of his intelligence and outstanding grades. He self taught himself Spanish and excelled at math and science. He was an honor roll student who dreamed of becoming a neurosurgeon. His addiction to crack cocaine in his later teens unfortunately led him to a life of petty crime, and he was in and out of prison for burglary to feed his addictions. At the time there was a cocaine epidemic in Miami, and he was at first arrested for possession several times before he began resorting to burglary. Even in between prison time where he was able to quit his addiction, he found it very difficult to find work as a convicted felon and again went back to burglary and violated his probation. He now wants to try and change people&#39;s lives after his encounter with Judge Glazer. Judge Glazer believes he can succeed, and she gave him a lesser prison sentence because of this. Booth thanks both Judge Glazer and his lawyer for having faith in him. Let&#39;s hope the very best for him.",positive

"Brahmins dominate intellectual and social positions. Academics, journalists, and activists have proponents of that tend to deemphasize the status of Brahmins or even to victim blame them. By creating a hierarchy of more and less oppressed groups, it has been used to create a narrative of blame that targets non-&#39;oppressed&#39; and &#39;privileged&#39; Brahmins in particular..<br><br>Brahmins are believed to achieve a higher level of success than the average population.  Brahmins receive relatively higher education, higher representation in managerial and occupational occupations and higher household incomes and higher family / martial stability, as well as less criminal than others.  The Brahmins marry into a Brahmin group, rejecting them as unsuitable for marriage or other close.  Personal relationship.  The Brahmins oppose integration and outright merger with the surrounding population.  Brahmins as minorities have long used it to remain homogeneous as there are separate communities within societies that have other practices and beliefs.  The practice of marrying within a Brahmin group encourages group affiliation and kinship.  This encourages the solidarity of the Brahmin group and ensures greater control over Brahmin group resources.  The Brahmins separated them and saved the rest of the society.  The Brahmins offer their services, and maintain their traditions and customs.  By remaining a reserve and isolated, the Brahmins maintain their cultural culture for a long time.<br><br>Anti-brahmin has been explained in terms of xenophobia, projected guilt, displaced aggression, and the search for a scapegoat. Some explanations assign partial blame to the perception of brahmin people as unsociable. Such a perception may have arisen by many brahmins having strictly kept to their own communities, with their own practices and laws. <br>It has also been suggested that parts of anti brahmin arose from a perception of brahmin people as greedy. Brahmins are stereotyped as &quot;greedy, conniving&quot;, without loyalty but &quot;always cheating, conspiring and plotting&quot; to subvert others.There is a widespread perception that brahmins are  &quot;perpetual foreigners&quot;. Brahmins are the target of assault, harassment, violence  and bullying from others due to the divisive stereotype.",negative

"Makes absolutely no sense to give the person 2x$20 and 2x$5 for a $43 if you were expecting to get change.<br>The person who put in $5 should have just given that money to whomever who chipped in a $20.  <br>Some 15 years ago, I was delivering food for a family restaurant.  The customer ordered a very small order, and was not quite meeting the minimum order we had.  he said it was just him eating, and I felt bad to ask him to order an extra order to meet the $20 minimum order we had.  I loved driving, so I said, I&#39;d do the delivery.  Handing the food over, he gave me some bills and some change, which appeared to be like 23.XX, for a bill that was 13.XX.  I assumed he wanted a clean $10 bill in change, which made sense, but also means, he meant to give me not even a single PENNY for a tip.  I was starting to regret why didn&#39;t I agreed to take the order, but I said I&#39;d do it, so I should own up to it.  Suddenly he storms out of the house and yells at me.  He said that I gave him the wrong amount and cheated him 15c, which kind of baffled me.  I delivered thousands of orders before, and this was one of my most memorable ones.",neutral

After 8-9 years passed by one day I went to my friend restaurant, and saw the guy cleaning, and doing stuff around. I couldn&#39;t stop thinking who he is! And one day again I was at the restaurant and he came to me and asked if i recognized him? I shakes my head in terms of no, and then he introduced himself to me. I couldn&#39;t believe it was him, he was on hardcore drugs, loosen a lot of teeth and weight. And after few min chat he asked me if i can help him to find a better job to get out of this dirty job. A lot of thought cross my mind within seconds. I couldn&#39;t believe how time change everything. I am grateful for what I have and what I am. And keep working to improve myself.<br>Now I have 22 people work under me and I tell them, if they need anything ask me but do not steal or lie to me.

Unless I say it is a tip, you should not assume it is a tip.  Then the guy comes back with a very f**ked up attitude when he was plainly in the wrong for what he did.  <br><br>He definitely deserved a tip and $8 (since the bill was $42) is more than fair, but he should not have assumed that was his tip nor should he have coped a huge attitude without any apology.

And these auto sales people can make tons of money from their jobs, and they’re trying to rip off a tip which is just a few dollars. For me, that’s just disgusting and abusing. Why would you rip off a guy who’s not rich like you and trying to get him fired? Seriously, can’t understand these auto sales dealers anymore!! I’m working as a babysitter since I’m a senior in high school, making $15/hour and that’s probably fine with me. But the point that I’m trying to make here is that if you’re trying to rip off the money of someone who doesn’t make much money like you, you’re officially an asshole. The Internet shut down this auto sales business? That’s great, cause I don’t wanna see those pigs in business anymore. I wish they could get worse punishments but anyway, as long as they don’t have any jobs to make money, that’s fine now. You rip off someone’s money, now you’ll get none! Karma is life, people.
