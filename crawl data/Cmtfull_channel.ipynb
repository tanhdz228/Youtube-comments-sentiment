Like Jordan and Kobe. There are similar or better skilled guys but did not win any championship rings. Good aim just mean you were born with good reaction time and vision and hand movement speed as gifts. But being clever with team and sense of the map, and enemy movement is more important, as among the pro players, no matter how good your aim is, if you face 2 players at the same time, mostly you don&#39;t have a chance to one tap both of them as regular casual players.\n",
